    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <p>
      Founded in 1972 by husband and wife duo Robert and Betty Salmons, Richmond Printing Service began as a small print shop rooted in passion, craftsmanship, and innovation. Robert, a lifelong print professional, entered the industry straight out of high school. Betty, a pioneer in her own right, became the first woman to enroll in camera and stripping classes at the Richmond Technical Center; a milestone that set the tone for the company’s trailblazing legacy. Today, RPS continues to be a family-owned business that their legacy continues through with their son, Robbie Salmons, who grew up in the family business. From generation to generation, our commitment to excellence has never wavered. When it comes to printing, our team is here to help you bring your vision to life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over five decades later, their vision still drives everything we do. What started as a family business has grown into a full-service printing operation known for precision, speed, service, and affordability. We’ve continued investing in cutting-edge technology and top-tier talent to deliver consistent quality, whether you're printing business cards, banners, or booklets.
